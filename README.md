# Welcome to the FairLLM Project

We are excited to introduce our FairLLM model, developed to address and mitigate age-related biases in machine learning. Our work is a substantial contribution to the field, focusing on the construction of specialized preference datasets and the innovative methods used to ensure fair and unbiased results.

## What's Included

- **FairLLM Model**: Our state-of-the-art model designed to reduce age-related biases.
- **Code**: All the necessary code to run and train the FairLLM model.
- **Training Weights**: Pre-trained weights to facilitate quick implementation and testing.
- **Preference Datasets**: Carefully curated datasets focusing on age-related biases, essential for developing and evaluating fair machine learning models.

## Coming Soon

We are finalizing the preparation of our resources and will make them available shortly. Here's what you can expect:

- **Model and Code**: Access the FairLLM model and its source code.
- **Training Weights**: Download pre-trained weights for immediate use.
- **Datasets**: Utilize our specialized preference datasets for your research on age biases.

Stay tuned for updates! We are committed to fostering further research in this critical area and look forward to seeing how our contributions can support and inspire your work.
