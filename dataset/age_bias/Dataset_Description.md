# Age Bias Datasets

This directory contains two datasets specifically curated to support research in AI ethics and bias mitigation, particularly focusing on age biases.

## Dataset Overview

### BBQ-AB
- **Description**: An augmented version of the original BBQ dataset, with an emphasis on age bias. This dataset is designed to provide a robust evaluation framework for biases related to age in AI systems.
- **Format**: The dataset is structured to facilitate easy integration with research projects and model (including LLM) training workflows.

### Kamruzzaman-AB
- **Description**: This dataset is curated to specifically address age bias, alongside other relevant biases such as beauty and institution. It offers a comprehensive set of data for a nuanced understanding of age-related biases in AI.
- **Format**: Organized to ensure compatibility with various machine learning (including LLM) and data analysis tools.

## Current Status
Our paper detailing the methodology and findings related to these datasets is currently under submission for peer review. We are committed to sharing our research to foster a deeper understanding of age biases in AI.

## Ongoing Development
In order to provide the best possible service to the academic community, we are continuously working on expanding and refining these datasets. Our goal is to offer a rich resource that can significantly contribute to the study of AI ethics and bias.

## Additional Resources
We will be providing a detailed dataset description document that will include:
- A thorough explanation of the data collection process.
- An in-depth analysis of the biases present in the datasets.
- Guidelines on how to effectively utilize these datasets in research.

Please stay tuned for updates and the release of our comprehensive dataset description document.
